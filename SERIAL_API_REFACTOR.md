# Serial API Refactoring - Non-Blocking Implementation

## Overview
The serial API in `main.cpp` has been refactored to eliminate blocking delays and improve system responsiveness. The main loop now runs at consistent timing intervals without being blocked by serial command processing.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Main Loop Timing Refactor
- **Removed**: `delay(50)` at the end of main loop
- **Added**: Non-blocking timing control using `lastMainLoopTime` and `MAIN_LOOP_INTERVAL`
- **Benefit**: Main loop maintains 50ms intervals without blocking other operations

### 2. Serial Input Processing
- **Created**: `processSerialInputs()` function for handling serial commands
- **Frequency**: Called more frequently during throttled periods for better responsiveness
- **Benefit**: Serial commands are processed even when main loop is throttled

### 3. AS8510 Diagnostic System
- **Replaced**: Blocking `diagnoseCurrentSensor()` with state machine approach
- **Added**: `runDiagnosticStep()` function with 500ms intervals between steps
- **State Variables**:
  - `diagnosticInProgress`: Tracks if diagnostic is running
  - `diagnosticStep`: Current step in diagnostic sequence
  - `diagnosticStepTime`: Timing for step intervals
  - `diagnosticSerial`: Target serial port for output

### 4. AS8510 Start Command
- **Replaced**: Blocking `delay(100)` with non-blocking timing
- **Added**: `startAS8510NonBlocking()` function
- **Benefit**: Command execution doesn't block main loop

## Technical Implementation

### Non-Blocking Main Loop Structure
```cpp
void loop() {
    unsigned long currentMillis = millis();
    
    // Throttle main loop without blocking
    if (currentMillis - lastMainLoopTime < MAIN_LOOP_INTERVAL) {
        processSerialInputs();        // Still process serial commands
        runDiagnosticStep();          // Continue diagnostic if running
        return;
    }
    lastMainLoopTime = currentMillis;
    
    // Main loop operations...
    processSerialInputs();            // Process again in main cycle
    runDiagnosticStep();              // Continue diagnostic if running
}
```

### Diagnostic State Machine
The diagnostic system now runs as a state machine with these steps:
1. **Step 0**: Initialize and check AS8510 status
2. **Step 1**: Print device configuration and status
3. **Step 2**: Read and display key registers (part 1)
4. **Step 3**: Read and display key registers (part 2)
5. **Step 4**: Read and display data registers
6. **Steps 5-9**: Perform 5 current measurements with timing
7. **Step 10**: Print detailed status and complete

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Responsiveness**: Main loop runs consistently at 50ms intervals
2. **Better Serial Handling**: Commands processed more frequently
3. **Non-Blocking Operations**: Long-running commands don't freeze the system
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing commands work the same way
5. **BMS Timing Stability**: Critical BMS operations maintain proper timing

## Usage

The refactored API maintains the same command interface:
- `current diag` - Starts non-blocking diagnostic sequence
- `start as8510` - Non-blocking AS8510 initialization
- All other commands remain unchanged

## Testing

The refactored code has been successfully compiled and tested:
- ✅ Compilation successful
- ✅ All function declarations updated
- ✅ Global variables properly scoped
- ✅ State machine logic implemented
- ✅ Non-blocking timing verified

## Future Enhancements

This refactoring provides a foundation for additional non-blocking operations:
- Parameter system updates could be made non-blocking
- Display updates could use similar state machine approach
- Additional diagnostic sequences could be added easily
